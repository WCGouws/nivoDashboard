# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

To get started:
- Assuming Node is installed on the machine, run ```npm i``` in the root directory in order to install all necessary packages
- Whilst in the root directory, run ```npm run dev``` to start the app in development mode, and navigate to the provided URL (for example http://localhost:5173)
